*After contracting a mysterious illness that brings you to your deathbed, you make a deal with the devil to save your life. In return for being cured of your illness and your mortality, you agree to fight your way through heaven, defeating Godâ€™s two guardians to the gates of heaven, then God themself. Be careful though, your life is quickly draining away and you must keep fighting to stay alive!
